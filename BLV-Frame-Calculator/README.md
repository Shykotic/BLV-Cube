# BLV-Frame-Calculator
 
-Note this assumes you are using the standard metal or printed parts.

I created a new frame calculator spreadsheet. It now allows you to change X, Y and bed size.  
You don't enter anything for X bed size.  
Enter the hole spacing for Y. This will calculate the size of 2020 extrusion you need.  
If you order the bed 2020 according to this calculator you will use "Bed_Holder_For_CR-10_bed_M4_screw"
