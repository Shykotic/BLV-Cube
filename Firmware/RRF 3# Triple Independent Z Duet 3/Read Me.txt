My printer has 3 independant Z steppers. You need to set the physical location of the pivot point not the lead screws with
M671 X-20:344:344 Y162.2:48.7:303.7 S10 ; set drive mapping: Z3=Left Front, Z4= Right Front, Z5=Right Rear

You need to keep the same order of M671 as the drive assignent in M584
M584 Z0.3:0.4:0.5

Set your probe boundaries. My BLTouch is in front of my hotend. M557 will be effected by M208

M557 X20:280 Y45:290 P4
